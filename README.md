Bachelor's thesis. Metaheuristic algorithms for vehicle routing problems with time windows and pick-up and delivery.

This paper deals with vehicle routing problem and its instances with limited capacity,
time windows and pick-up and delivery. Detailed description of the problem is
given, as well as of the two metaheuristic algorithms that were used: genetic algorithm
with tournament selection and evolution strategy algorithm. Three forms of results,
mutation and crossover operators and two local operators were implemented. The dependence
of the quality of the solution on the form of result, used algorithm and the
use of local operators was explored. The obtained results are shown graphically and
analyzed.

Should be used with ECF framework.
